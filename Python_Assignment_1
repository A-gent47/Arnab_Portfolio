Functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on are sys.version, sys.version_info, and sys.hexversion.

The maximum possible length of an identifier in Python is unlimited.
Some benefits of using Python include its simplicity and readability, extensive standard libraries and third-party modules, interoperability with other languages, support for multiple programming paradigms, and wide usage in various fields such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.
Memory in Python is managed by the Python Memory Manager. It includes a private heap space where all Python objects and data structures are located. When an object is no longer in use, Python’s garbage collector automatically frees the memory.
To install Python on Windows and set path variables, you can download the Python installer from the official website, run the installer, and ensure that the checkbox that says “Add Python to PATH” is checked before the installation.
